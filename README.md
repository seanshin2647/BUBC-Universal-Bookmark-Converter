# BUBC Universal Bookmark Converter

# Description
The BUBC Universal Bookmark Converter, or BUBC for short, is a program designed to allow for a more easier transition between browsers. 

While desktop browsers generally use a Netscape ".html" file, some mobile browsers use more niche formats like ".db", and do not have sufficient tools for conversion. Even popular mobile browsers like Firefox Mobile cannot import bookmarks unless done so in an indirect manner such as going through the desktop application and then enabling sync.

This tool is meant to solve this problem. BUBC accepts bookmark files in the ".db" format, and then converts them to the standard Netscape ".html" format.
